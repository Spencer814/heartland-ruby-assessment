# Challenge Note

This challenge was a fun weekend project. I have never worked with Ruby before and my first attempt seemed to overly complicate the code. In that first attempt I approached things as if I were writing this in JavaScript, but then I scrapped all of that and then started over by writing basic functions that achieved the aims listed in the requirements.

I may have missed some things but I do believe that working with the language more would allow me to identify things that could be done better or more efficiently, especially in the unit test. I tried to add inline documentation for functions but I don't quite know what the best practices when it comes to that.

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to show my abilities.
