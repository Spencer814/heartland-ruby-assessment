# Photo Renaming Challenge

Mike, an avid traveler, has a collection of photos that need to be reorganized. He wants to group his photos by city, sort them by the time they were taken, and assign each photo a consecutive natural number within each city group. Additionally, he wants to rename each photo with the city name and a zero-padded number.

## Problem Statement

You are given a string representing a list of photos in the following format:

```shell
"<photoname>.<extension>, <city_name>, yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"
```

- `<photoname>` is the name of the photo.
- `<extension>` is the file extension ("jpg," "png," or "jpeg").
- `<city_name>` is the name of the city where the photo was taken.
- `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss` is the timestamp of when the photo was taken.

Your task is to write a function that takes this input string and returns a string representing the list of new names for all photos, following Mike's renaming criteria.

## Function Signature

```ruby
def solution(s: str) -> str:
    pass
```

## Example

For example, given the input string:

```shell
"photo.jpg, Krakow, 2013-09-05 14:08:15
Mike.png, London, 2015-06-20 15:13:22
myFriends.png, Krakow, 2013-09-05 14:07:13
Eiffel.jpg, Florianopolis, 2015-07-23 08:03:02
pisatower.jpg, Florianopolis, 2015-07-22 23:59:59
BOB.jpg, London, 2015-08-05 00:02:03
notredame.png, Florianopolis, 2015-09-01 12:00:00
me.jpg, Krakow, 2013-09-06 15:40:22
a.png, Krakow, 2016-02-13 13:33:50
b.jpg, Krakow, 2016-01-02 15:12:22
c.jpg, Krakow, 2016-01-02 14:34:30
d.jpg, Krakow, 2016-01-02 15:15:01
e.png, Krakow, 2016-01-02 09:49:09
f.png, Krakow, 2016-01-02 10:55:32
g.jpg, Krakow, 2016-02-29 22:13:11"
```

Your function should return:

```shell
Krakow02.jpg
London1.png
Krakow01.png
Florianopolis2.jpg
Florianopolis1.jpg
London2.jpg
Florianopolis3.png
Krakow03.jpg
Krakow09.png
Krakow07.jpg
Krakow06.jpg
Krakow08.jpg
Krakow04.png
Krakow05.png
Krakow10.jpg
```

The photos are grouped by city, sorted by timestamp, and assigned numbers as per Mike's request.

## Constraints

- `M` is an integer within the range (1..100).
- Each year is an integer within the range (2000..2020).
- Each line of the input string follows the specified format and is separated by newline characters.
- Photo names and city names consist only of English alphabet letters (1-20 characters).
- City names start with a capital letter followed by lowercase letters.
- No two photos from the same location share the same date and time.
- Each extension is "jpg," "png," or "jpeg."

In your solution, focus on correctness and efficiency.
